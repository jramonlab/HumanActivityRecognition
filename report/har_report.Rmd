## Introduction

This is a report showing the process and results for the creation of a model for human activity recognition (herafter HAR). 

This is the capstone project of the Data Science course pursued by the author in HarvardX.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [**HAR Dataset for benchmarking**](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/static/har/dataset-har-PUC-Rio-ugulino.zip) 1

The dataset includes measurements of **inertial sensors** attached to several person while doing normal activities during the day. It also includes data related to the person such as weight, height, etc.

A more detailed description of the dataset can be found [**here**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wearable+Computing%3A+Classification+of+Body+Postures+and+Movements+%28PUC-Rio%29)

The main goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques in order to predict the human activity. We will compare our results

We will also observe if all 4 sensors are really necessary or if we can use less sensors in order to predict the activity. 

## Analysis

In this section we will prepare the data to work with and explore some important characteristics of the dataset.

### Data wrangling
The created har dataset has the following structure:

See the different activites listed in the dataset:
```{r}
levels(har$class)
```

These classes are associated to the values obtained by the sensors (1 to 4) expressed in m/s2. X, Y, Z are the values obtained for each axis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

In order to understand how th values were taken we will view the sampled data **across the time for sensor 1 values (x,y,z)**. The data was taken during 8 hours. During this time the sensed subject was doing different activites.

<center>
![](..\\figs\\Raw_Data\\S1-waist.png){width=600px}
</center>
This is the sensor located at the waist of the subjects.

**Note** the **unit time** is not specified. We have included a non-scaled time unit for creating the chart.

Some additional **checkings** have been done in order to verify the consistency of data.

```{r}
# Is there any NAs ?
nas <- apply(har, MARGIN = 2, function(x) any(is.na(x) | is.infinite(x)))
if (any(nas) == FALSE) 
{
  cat("Great, no NAs or Infinite value in the dataset")
}else{
  cat("Attention, some NA or Infinite value was found in the dataset")
}
```

```{r classes, echo = FALSE}
# proportion of classes ?
har %>% group_by(class) %>% summarize(n = n(), p = n()/nrow(.)) %>% arrange(desc(p))
```


```{r classes-and-users, echo = FALSE}
# check proportion of classes and users ?
har %>% group_by(class, user) %>% summarize(n = n(), p = n()/nrow(.)) %>% arrange(desc(p))

```

Now, we are sure there are NA values in our dataset.
Also we are sure all users (4) have been measured in all the  different activities (5). Note the prevalance in some user/activity. This also can be observed in the time-based chart above.
